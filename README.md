# simple-flux
A simple Flux implementation without any build requirements or dependencies. This is easier to learn, but for real projects you should consider [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) instead!

## Getting Started
This library is just an `sf` module with two properties: `dispatcher` is based on the [Flux reference dispatcher](https://github.com/facebook/flux/blob/master/src/Dispatcher.js), and `createStore` is a helper function for creating simple stores that work with this dispatcher.
